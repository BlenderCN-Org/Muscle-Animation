This includes all of my work towards an animation I want to create:
  - Sentient muscles use rocks from cave as bones, creating 'muscle-man'
  - Muscle-man exits cave and self-actualizes at reflection in (?) river/mud puddle/tar pit
  - (?) Mud/tar becomes skin, and man is complete
  - Man sees muscle-woman exit cave, points her to (?) river/mud puddle/tar pit

Idea was formed with friend, and I will give credit to help received (after seeing if people want the credit).
